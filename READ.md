Project: Face Detection & Neural Network with 2D Transformations
Introduction
This repository contains the source code and documentation related to the implementation of face detection algorithms and neural network models, combined with 2D transformations such as sliding windows and image pyramids.
Features
Face detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and the sliding window method.
Building neural network models with the ability to automatically adjust the number of hidden layers, suitable for different levels of task complexity.
Applying 2D transformations to optimize object detection in image space.
Integration of linear regression and neural network models for prediction and classification tasks.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
NumPy & OpenCV: For 2D image processing and transformations.
Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training neural networks.
Objective
The main goal of this project is to provide an optimized and flexible solution for object detection tasks in image space, combining both traditional techniques and modern methods like neural networks. This project can be extended and applied in various fields such as computer vision, security and surveillance, or intelligent system development.
